imagining Ethereum as a metaphor for a shared computer, it should be noted that computation alone is not enough. For a computer to be fully useful, it also needs storage to "remember" things and bandwidth to "communicate" them. This could be summarised as such:

1. Contracts: decentralized logic
2. Swarm: decentralized storage
3. Whisper: decentralized messaging
