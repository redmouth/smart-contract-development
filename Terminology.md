# Block Height,blockchain height
The height of a block is the number of blocks in the chain between it and the genesis block. (So the genesis block has height 0). <br> 
The height of the block chain is usually taken to be the height of the highest block, in the chain with greatest total difficulty; i.e. the length of the chain minus one. <br>
